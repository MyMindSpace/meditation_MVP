  "script": "Find a comfortable position, either lying down or sitting. Close your eyes gently.  Let your body sink into whatever surface supports you. [pause]\n\nNow, bring your attention to your breath.  Notice the natural rhythm of your inhales and exhales.  Don't try to change it, just observe.  [pause]  Feel the gentle rise and fall of your abdomen or chest.  [pause]\n\n\nWe'll begin our body scan meditation, starting with your toes.  Bring your awareness to your toes on your right foot.  Notice any sensations â€“ tingling, warmth, coolness, pressure.  Simply observe without judgment.  [pause]  Breathe in, and with each exhale, feel any tension release from your right toes. [pause]\n\n\nNow, move your attention to the soles of your right foot.  Feel the contact with the surface beneath you.  [pause] Then, your right ankle, your right calf, and your right knee.  With each exhale, release any tension you find. [pause]\n\n\nNow bring your awareness to your right thigh, your right hip. [pause] Feel the weight of your leg resting comfortably. [pause]\n\n\nLet's move to the left side of your body.  Focus on your left toes, feeling any sensations.  [pause] Then your left foot, your left ankle, your left calf, your left knee, your left thigh, and your left hip. [pause]  Breathe deeply, allowing relaxation to flow through your legs with each exhale.  [pause]\n\n\nNow, bring your attention to your pelvis.  Feel the support of your body underneath you. [pause] Notice your abdomen, your lower back, your middle back, and your upper back.  Allow any tension to melt away with each breath. [pause]\n\n\nLet your awareness move to your chest and your shoulders. Notice any tightness or tension. Allow your shoulders to soften and relax. [pause]\n\n\nBring your awareness to your arms.  Your right arm, from your hand to your shoulder.  [pause] And then your left arm, from your hand to your shoulder.  Feel the weight of your arms resting gently.  [pause]\n\n\nNow, bring your attention to your neck and throat. Release any tension held here.  [pause]  Feel your jaw relax. Let your mouth soften slightly. [pause]\n\n\nFinally, bring your awareness to your head.  Your forehead, your temples, your scalp. [pause] Feel the gentle coolness of the air on your skin. [pause]\n\n\nTake one more deep breath in, and as you exhale, feel the peace and relaxation spread throughout your entire body. [pause]\n\n\nGently bring your awareness back to the room. Wiggle your fingers and toes, and when you are ready, slowly open your eyes.  [pause]  Carry this sense of calm and relaxation with you throughout your day.\n",
